### Expense Calculator
- React
- CSS
- HTML
- Astro

This is my first react project that I created to help me calculate my expenses. 
I wanted to create a simple app that would allow me to input my expenses and have 
the app calculate the total amount of expenses. The GUI is simple and easy to use, although not the best looking, 
I was mainly interested in getting the react functionality down.
